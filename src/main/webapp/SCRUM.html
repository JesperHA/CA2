            <p>What is returned by these two endpoints (MIME type, and what does the content represent) </p>
            <h4>TODO:</h4>
            Sprint one (Friday 04/10 - Monday 07/10): 
            The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project.
            The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).
            The CI-pipeline must be setup
            Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests
            Sprint two (Tuesday 8/10 - Wednesday 9/10):
            Most of the Entity Classes should be ready
            Sample data should be available in the dev-database
            Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and integrations tests
            Sprint three (Thursday 10/10- Sunday 13/10):
            Complete the API (as much as you have time for)
